\section{Methods}
\label{sect:Methods}
In this section we describe the methods we use.  We begin by describing the homogenisation of the radar reflectivity (Z), power-law conversion of reflectivity to rainfall computed using distrometer data and the processing of the raw Z data, conversion to seasonal summer (DJF) data, processing to events and finally the statistical modelling we do.  Our approach is based on the idea that extreme rainfall events are random events dependent on some variable. For example, temperature, and by extreme we mean the seasonal maximum at each location within 100 km of a radar station and over land.

\subsection{Radar reflectivity processing}
\label{subsect:process}
For each calendar month, the corrected radar data was  processed  as follows: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Any reflectivity value $> 55$ dBZ were set to missing, as these are values likely contaminated by hail.
    \item dbZ values were converted to rain fall rates using the power law derived from the distrometers.  To remove drizzle and other potential contaminants  any reflectivity  $< 15 $ dBZ  had a rain fall rate of 0.0 mm/h set. 
    \item The rain fall data was then spatially averaged from a nominal 500m x 500m resolution to 2000 x 2000 m. 
    \item The sample resolution was computed as the median of the differences between times. 
    \item A count of the number of scans and rainfall rates $> 1$ mm/h was computed. 
    \item Rain fall rates were averaged to periods of 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4 and 8 hours with the requirement that at least 75\% of the scans were present. 
    \item Counts of the number of scans, mean rainfall over all present scans and, for all time-averaged rain fall rates, the maximum and date/time of maximum computed at each location in the grid.
\end{enumerate}
Say something about computation of beam blockage and how handle multiple blockage datasets. 

The monthly data were then further processed:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Months with a sample resolution of more than 15 minutes were set missing.  
\item Summer (DJF) values were extracted.
\item Sea points and points where the cumulative beam blockage fraction (probably need to say how this is computed) was less than 0.5 were set missing.  

\item Seasonal maximum, date/time of maximum, means and number of scan were computed at each location from the monthly values.
\item Seasons which had less than 70\% of the maximum possible scans and less than 3 months were removed. 
\item To remove potential radar artefacts, locations with more than 20\% of rain rates  $> 1 $mm/h were set missing. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Event generation and statistical model fitting}
\label{subsect:event}
Our goal is to use the spatial coverage of radar data to estimate extreme distributions and uncertainties in those distributions. That requires generating independent samples of extreme rainfall. Extreme rainfall events are associated with systems that move across the landscape and so extremes close by in time and space are unlikely to be independent.  We used a relatively crude way of doing this and defined an event,  as all extreme rainfall occurring on the same local  day.  Within that event, quantiles are computed at values from $0$ to $1$ in steps of $0.05$. Each of these quantile values had their position, time, and topographic height recorded. The event area is also recorded.
To compute a distribution for each radar, we take all radar events and sample randomly, for each event, from within the quantiles. An GEV is then fit to this data \citep{gilleland2016extremes} with the data weighted by the number of cells in the event. This process was repeated 100 times and the fit parameters and parameter covariances averaged. To compute uncertainties the events were bootstrapped 100 times with a random quantile selected from each bootstrap and a GEV fit done for each sample. Standard deviations were computed for the parameters of interest, and then 10-90\% uncertainties computed from those standard deviations.  Statistical models with and without a local temperature covariate were used, and the AIC used to determine if  the model with a local temperature covariate was an improvement on the model without. 



\section{Introduction}

This document will provide authors with the basic American Meteorological
Society (AMS) formatting guidelines. This document was created using \LaTeX\
and demonstrates how to use the \LaTeX\ template when submitting a manuscript
to the AMS.  The following sections will outline the guidelines and
formatting for text, math, figures, and tables while using \LaTeX\/ for a
submission to the AMS. An attempt to compile amspaper.tex should be made
before using the template. The files have been tested on Windows, Linux, and
Mac OS using \TeX\ Live 2019 (available online at
\url{http://www.tug.org/texlive/}). Feedback and questions should be sent to
latex@ametsoc.org. Additional information is available on the AMS \LaTeX\ Submission Info
web page (\url{http://www2.ametsoc.org/ams/index.cfm/publications/authors/journal-and-bams-authors/author-resources/latex-author-info/}).

Authors should use the empty template.tex to begin their
paper. A valuable source of \LaTeX\ information is the {TeX
Frequently Asked Questions} page (available online at \url{faq.tug.org}).

\section{Formatting text and sections}
The text should be divided into sections, each with a separate heading and
consecutive numbering. Note, however, that single secondary, tertiary, and
quaternary sections remain unnumbered. Each section heading should be placed
on a separate line using the appropriate \LaTeX\ commands. 

\subsection*{Secondary headings} 
Secondary headings labeled with letters are formatted using the
$\backslash$subsection$*${\tt\string{\string}} for a single
subsection within a section or
or $\backslash$subsection{\tt\string{\string}} 
for multiple
subsections within one section.

\subsubsection*{Tertiary headings} 
Tertiary headings are formatted using the
$\backslash$subsubsection$*${\tt\string{\string}} for single a subsubsection
within a subsection or
$\backslash$subsubsection{\tt\string{\string}} 
for multiple subsubsections
within a subsection. 

\paragraph*{Quaternary headings} 
Quaternary headings are formatted using the
$\backslash$paragraph$*${\tt\string{\string}} for a single paragraph within
a subsubsection or
$\backslash$paragraph{\tt\string{\string}} 
for multiple paragraphs
within a subsection.

\section{Citations}
Citations to standard references in text should consist of the name of the
author and the year of publication, for example, \citet{Becker+Schmitz2003} or
\citep{Becker+Schmitz2003} using the appropriate $\backslash$citet\ or
$\backslash$citep commands, respectively. A variety of citation formats can
be used with the natbib package; however, the AMS prefers that authors use only the $\backslash$citet\ and
$\backslash$citep commands. References should be entered in the references.bib file. For a thorough
discussion of how to enter references into the references.bib database file
following AMS style, please refer to the \textbf{AMS\_RefsV5.pdf} document
included in this package.

\section{Formatting math}
The following sections will outline the basic formatting rules for
mathematical symbols and units.  In addition, a review of the amspaper.tex
file will show how this is done with the use of \LaTeX\ commands.  The AMS
template provides the American Mathematical Society math, font, symbol, and
boldface packages for use in math mode.

\subsection{Mathematical symbols}
Symbols must be of the same font style both in text discussion and in
displayed equations or terms (and figures should be prepared to match).
Scalar single-character symbols are set italic, Greek, or script. Examples
are $u$, $L$ [note that $\upsilon$ (Greek upsilon) is used instead of
\textit{v} (italic ``vee'') to avoid confusion with $\nu$ (Greek nu) often
used for viscosity; this is handled automatically when in \LaTeX\ math mode],
$w$, $x$, $y$, $z$, $f$, $g$, $r$, indices such as $i$ or $j$, and constants
such as $C_D$, $k$, or $K$. Multiple-character scalar variables,
abbreviations, nondimensional numbers, and acronyms for variables are set
regular nonitalic: $\mathrm{LWC}$, $\mathrm{Re}$, $\mathrm{Ro}$,
$\mathrm{BT}$, $\mathrm{abs}$, $\mathrm{obs}$, $\mathrm{max}$,
$\mathrm{min}$, $\mathrm{Re}$/$\mathrm{Im}$ (real/imaginary), etc. For
vectors, use boldface nonitalic Times Roman as in $\mathbf{V}$, $\mathbf{v}$,
or $\mathbf{x}$, and $\mathbf{i}$, $\mathbf{j}$, and $\mathbf{k}$ unit
vectors. Do not use the \LaTeX\ $\backslash$vec command to denote vectors.
For matrix notation, use nonitalic boldface Arial (or sans serif) font as in
$\bm{\mathsf{A}}$, $\bm{\mathsf{B}}$, or $\bm{\mathsf{M}}$.  All mathematical
operator abbreviations/acronyms are set lowercase regular Roman font, except
$O$ (on the order of): $\sin$, $\cos$, $\tan$, $\tanh$, $\mathrm{cov}$, $\Pr$
(for probability; note same as Prandtl number), $\mathrm{const}$ (for
constant), $\mathrm{c.c.}$ (complex conjugate).

\subsection{Units}
Units are always set on a single line with a space separating the
denominator, which is set with a superscript $-1$, $-2$, and so on, rather
than using a slash for ``per.'' Examples are g kg$^{-1}$, m$^2$ s$^{-1}$, W
m$^{-2}$, g m$^{-3}$, and m s$^{-1}$ (note that ms$^{-1}$ is the unit for
``per millisecond'').

\subsection{Equations}
Brief equations or terms set inline in text must be set as a single-line
expression because page proofs are not double spaced, for example,
$\rho^{-1}p/x$ or $(1/{\rho})p/x$ or $(a-b)/(c+d)$; that is, use a
superscript $-1$ for the denominator. In case of a more complicated term or
equation, it should be set as an unnumbered display equation, such as
\begin{displaymath} x=\frac{2b\pm\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2c}.  \end{displaymath}

Otherwise, numbered display equations can be entered using the appropriate
equation command, such as \begin{equation}
x=\frac{2b\pm\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2c}.  \end{equation}

Lists of equations are punctuated as written English, and commas, semicolons,
and periods are placed where appropriate. Conjunctions such as ``and,''
``while,'' ``when,'' or ``for'' are also typically placed before the final
element in a mathematical phrase, as befits the intended mathematical
meaning.  



\section{Figures and tables}
The AMS prefers that all figures and tables are placed {\bf at the end of the document} prior to submission. 
A list of tables and a list of figures will appear near the end of the PDF
file, before the actual tables and figures. These lists are necessary for submission.

For appendix figures and tables, special commands are needed to manually 
change the numbering to ensure that each appendix figure or table is numbered 
as part of the respective appendix and not as a continuation of the main paper. Use the command
$\backslash$appendcaption\{\} instead of the usual $\backslash$caption\{\} to adjust the 
numbering; for example, for Table A1, you would use the command \verb+\appendcaption{A1}+.

Note that the normal $\backslash$ref\{\} command cannot be used to cite 
appendix figures and tables as the numbering will be incorrect. Callouts for appendix figures 
and tables in the text will need to be written out as plain text, for example, Fig. A1 and Table A1.

\subsection{Figures}
The insertion of a sample figure (Fig. \ref{f1})  
and caption is given below (in the .tex document) and at the end of the document. Standard figure sizes are 19 (one column), 
27, 33, and 39 (two columns) picas.

%  \caption{Enter the caption for your figure here.  Repeat as
%  necessary for each of your figures. Figure from \protect\cite{Knutti2008}.}\label{f1}
%\end{figure}
%

\subsection{Tables}
Each table must be numbered, provided with a caption, and mentioned
specifically in the text. 
See below (in the .tex document) and at the end of the document for the formatting of a sample table (Table \ref{t1}).

% ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\acknowledgments
Keep acknowledgments (note correct spelling: no ``e'' between the ``g'' and
``m'') as brief as possible. In general, acknowledge only direct help in
writing or research. Financial support (e.g., grant numbers) for the work
done, for an author, or for the laboratory where the work was performed is
best acknowledged here rather than as footnotes to the title or to an
author's name. Contribution numbers (if the work has been published by the
author's institution or organization) should be included as footnotes on the title page,
not in the acknowledgments.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 
%
\datastatement
The data availability statement is where authors should describe how the data underlying 
the findings within the article can be accessed and reused. Authors should attempt to 
provide unrestricted access to all data and materials underlying reported findings. 
If data access is restricted, authors must mention this in the statement.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% APPENDIXES
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% If only one appendix, use
%%\appendix%

%% If more than one appendix, use \appendix[<letter>], e.g.,
 \appendix[A] 

\appendixtitle{Title of Appendix}


\subsection*{Appendix section}

The AMS template allows authors to format an unlimited number of
appendixes. To format a single appendix, use the $\backslash$appendix
command with no additional argument. Otherwise, add the appropriate
one-letter argument to the $\backslash$appendix command (e.g.
$\backslash$appendix[A], $\backslash$appendix[B],
$\backslash$appendix[C], etc.) corresponding to the appropriate
appendix. 


The title of the appendix can be formatted using the
$\backslash$appendixtitle{\tt\string{\string}} 
 command. The $\backslash$subsection, $\backslash$subsubection,
and $\backslash$paragraph commands are used to create sections within
the appendix. (Note that the appendix title takes the place of $\backslash$section 
in the appendix, so the first section should begin with $\backslash$subsection
instead of $\backslash$section.)
 Equations are automatically numbered appropriately for 
each appendix. Here is an example of the first equation in appendix
A, automatically labeled (\ref{eq:1}): 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:1}
x=\frac{2b\pm\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2c}.  
\end{equation}

For appendix figures and tables, special commands are needed to manually 
change the numbering to ensure that each appendix figure or table is numbered 
as part of the appendix and not as a continuation of the main paper. Use the command
$\backslash$appendcaption\{\} instead of the usual $\backslash$caption\{\} to adjust the 
numbering; for example, for Table A1, you would use the command \verb+\appendcaption{A1}+.
In-text callouts for each appendix figure and table will need to be written as plain text;
the usual $\backslash$ref\{\} command cannot be used.

\appendix[C]
\appendixtitle{Building a PDF and Submitting Your 
\LaTeX\ Manuscript Files to the AMS}

\subsection{Building your own PDF}
There are a variety of different methods and programs that will create a
final PDF from your \LaTeX\ files. The easiest method is to download one of
the freely available text editors/compilers such as TexWorks or TeXnicCenter.
TexWorks is installed with the TeXLive distribution and provides both a text
editor and the ability to compile your files into a PDF.

\subsection{Submitting your files to the AMS for peer review}
The AMS uses the Editorial Manager system for all author submissions for
peer review. Editorial Manager uses the freely available \TeX\ Live 2018
distribution. This system will automatically generate a PDF from your
submitted \LaTeX\ files and figures.  

You should not upload your own PDF into
the system. If the system does not build the PDF from your files correctly,
refer to the AMS \LaTeX\ FAQ page first for possible solutions. If your PDF
still does not build correctly after trying the solutions on the FAQ page, email
latex@ametsoc.org for help.

\subsection{Other software}
As mentioned above, there is a variety of software that can be used to edit
.tex files and build a PDF.  The AMS does not support \LaTeX\/-related
WYSIWYG software, such as Scientific Workplace, or WYSIWYM software, such as
LyX.  \TeX\ Live (available online at \\ \url{http://www.tug.org/texlive/}) is
recommended for users needing an up-to-date \LaTeX\ distribution with
software that includes an editor and the ability to automatically generate a
PDF.

Values are shown for accumulation periods of 30 mins, 1, 2 and 4 hours. Regional averages are shown in the right column. Stars show values from Brisbane calibration. Station names are coloured green, orange or red when Rx1h fractional changes are significantly greater than 0, 7.5 or 15 \%/K respectively.}
